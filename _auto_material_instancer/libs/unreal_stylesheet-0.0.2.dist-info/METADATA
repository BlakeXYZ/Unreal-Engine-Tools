## Installation
PIP install the [latest release](https://pypi.org/project/unreal-stylesheet/) from PYPi (recommended):
```
python -m pip install unreal-stylesheet
```
or install from the repo:
```
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/leixingyu/unrealStylesheet
```

## Using the stylesheet

Simply import `unreal_stylesheet` and call `setup()`:  

```python
# ensure you have a Qt application:
# app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv)

import unreal_stylesheet
unreal_stylesheet.setup()

# show your qt widgets
# window = YourTool()
# window.show()
```

## Contribute

Feel free to make a PR or issue if you find a bug, or want to request a feature.  
Some guidelines to modify this stylesheet:

### Modifying the style sheet

You can modify the `.qss` style sheet directly,  
or you can modify on top of the _CSS_ preprocessor `.scss` file.  
Once finished, re-compile the `.qss`:   
```commandline
qtsass ue.scss -o ue.qss
```

> Documentation about .scss can be found: [Sass Official website](https://sass-lang.com/guide)
>
> You'll also need to install a Qt specific Sass: [qt-sass](https://github.com/spyder-ide/qtsass)

### Modifying icons

The icons are handled with Qt's resource system (to learn more, visit [here](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/resources.html))

You can modify the `.qrc` file and re-compile the `.rcc` as follows:

```commandline
rcc -binary icons.qrc -o icons.rcc
```
